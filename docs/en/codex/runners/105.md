## SCOPE
Add a minimal GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci-smoke.yml` that runs on push/PR,
sets up Python 3.11, installs `requirements.txt` if present, and attempts `flake8`/`pytest` if available
(no hard failure if they are missing). Mark `ci_smoke=100` in progress.

## CONSTRAINTS
- Idempotent and non-destructive.
- Keep existing workflows intact.
- Do not touch application code.

## ACCEPTANCE
- Workflow file `.github/workflows/ci-smoke.yml` exists.
- On next push/PR, the job runs successfully (or skips gracefully if tools not present).

## PROGRESS
- Phase 1: `ci_smoke=100`

## TESTS
- If `pytest` is installed, tests must pass; otherwise, no-op.
