from: {
  email: 'your-email@yourdomain.com',
  name: 'Your App Name'
}

### Modify Approver Email Mapping
Edit `src/hooks/useApprovals.ts`:
```typescript
const roleEmailMap: Record<ApproverRole, string> = {
  'admin': 'admin@yourdomain.com',
  'manager': 'manager@yourdomain.com',
  // Add more roles...
};
```

### Customize Email Templates
Edit the HTML content in `send-approval-notification` edge function for each notification type.

## Testing
1. Create a draft rule
2. Request approval (check approver email)
3. Approve/reject request (check requester email)
4. Monitor Supabase Edge Function logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting
- **Emails not sending:** Check SENDGRID_API_KEY is set correctly
- **Emails in spam:** Verify sender domain in SendGrid
- **Wrong recipients:** Update roleEmailMap in useApprovals.ts
- **Template issues:** Check edge function logs in Supabase dashboard
